Congratulations, you now have a new theory of $dir !

Your next steps will likely be:

* to implement a decision procedure for your theory by implementing
  Theory$camel::check() in theory_$dir.cpp. Before writing the actual
  code, you will need :

  * to determine which data structures are context dependent and use for
    them context-dependent data structures (context/cd*.h)
  * to choose which work will be done at QUICK_CHECK, STANDARD or at
    FULL_EFFORT.

You'll probably find the Developer's wiki useful:

  http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu/wiki/

...and in particular the Developer's Guide:

  http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu/wiki/Developer%27s_Guide

which contains coding guidelines for the CVC4 project.

Good luck, and please contact cvc4-devel@cs.nyu.edu for assistance
should you need it!
