#+TITLE: Separation logic provers
#+AUTHOR: Nicolas `Niols` Jeannerod <niols@niols.fr>
#+STARTUP: indent

This document references different provers that can handle separation
logic and prove satisfiability.

Satisfiability can of course always be asked to entailment provers by
asking if {A} skip {false} and negating the answer. However, this
might have an impact on the performances.

* Asterix

* CVC4
- will be extended to support separation logic
- sep logic writen in SMT libs input. Java support for SMT libs?

* Cyclist
- full fragment of inductive predicates and symbolic heaps
- open source

* S2SAT
- closed source

* smallfoot

* Span
- SMT libs input
